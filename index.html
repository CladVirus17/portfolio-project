                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Luke and I am a motivated student ready to start my career in web/software development!</p>
                <p>My love for developing started many years ago back in my freshman year of high school. When I was a freshman I started taking some computer classes like intro to computers, game design, etc. Nothing too crazy or advanced. However, I started to slowly make my way towards the highest computer classes offered at my school until by my junior year, I had finished all of them! From then on I had to start taking college courses relating to the web development degree at MPTC which eventually led me to where I am today.</p>
